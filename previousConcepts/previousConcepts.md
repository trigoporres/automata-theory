**Set**: Collection of objects called elements or members. It is said that a set is infinite when it has infinite number of elements. Examples:

- Vowels: **V = {a, e, i, o, u}** *(set is finite)*

- Natural numbers: **N = {1,2,3,4,5,6,...}** *(set is infinite)*

**Cardinality of a set** is the size of the set, that is, the number of elements the set has. It is represented by two vertical lines.

- |V| = 5

**Empty set**: Set that has no element. Is represented with: **∅**

**Membership**: V = {a,e,i,o,u} **a ∈ V**
